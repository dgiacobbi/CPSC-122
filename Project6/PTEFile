WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER’S DAY?
THOU ART MORE LOVELY AND MORE TEMPERATE:
ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY,
AND SUMMER’S LEASE HATH ALL TOO SHORT A DATE:
SOMETIME TOO HOT THE EYE OF HEAVEN SHINES,
AND OFTEN IS HIS GOLD COMPLEXION DIMM’D;
AND EVERY FAIR FROM FAIR SOMETIME DECLINES,
BY CHANCE OR NATURE’S CHANGING COURSE UNTRIMM’D;
BUT THY ETERNAL SUMMER SHALL NOT FADE
NOR LOSE POSSESSION OF THAT FAIR THOU OWEST;
NOR SHALL DEATH BRAG THOU WANDER’ST IN HIS SHADE,
WHEN IN ETERNAL LINES TO TIME THOU GROWEST:
SO LONG AS MEN CAN BREATHE OR EYES CAN SEE,
SO LONG LIVES THIS AND THIS GIVES LIFE TO THEE.
